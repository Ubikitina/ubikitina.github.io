This weekend, I had the pleasure of attending my first-ever open space conference: [TheAntiEvent](https://theantievent.org/). What a rewarding experience it was.

Held in Bilbo, just a short walk from my home (which was a lovely bonus), these two days were a powerful reminder of why I fell in love with technology in the first place. It wasn't about corporate agendas or polished talks; it was about **people**, shared experiences, and reconnecting with the heart of our craft.

I'm leaving with recharged energy and a notebook full of insights. Here are some of my key takeaways.



## The Power of Human Connections

If I had to distill TheAntiEvent down to one essential truth, it would be this: **software is built by people, for people.** This kept running through my mind all weekend.

I connected with incredible people from across the sector—all remarkably approachable and genuine. In a field that can often feel individualistic, lonely, and sometimes particularly hostile to women, we created a safe space where we could share experiences and support one another.

> This event was a living example of how powerful community can be. Spaces like this only exist because everyone shows up, heart and soul.

When that happens, something magical occurs: **1+1 doesn't equal 2; it equals so much more.** Our different points of view, our diverse ways of doing things, and our willingness to grow together don't just add up—they multiply possibilities.



## Tools & Craft: Rethinking how we work and learn

What made the sessions at TheAntiEvent so special was how they pushed beyond technical specifics into the deeper currents of our craft. The conversations weren't just about *what* we build, but *how* and *why* we build it.

We explored themes that resonate with every developer's journey:
*   The role of **ethics at work** and navigating complex interpersonal dynamics.
*   The spark behind **side projects**—how we learn, what we value in creating something new, and finding motivation in the passion to build and share with others.
*   The crucial need for **creativity** and out-of-the-box thinking in our daily work.

This reflective atmosphere particularly reshaped my perspective on **AI and development**. The discussions challenged my reliance on AI assistants, sparking a desire to reconnect with the craft in a more hands-on way.

> I'm rethinking how I use AI for development, and I'm excited to experiment with "vibe coding" using tools like Cursor. It feels like an opportunity to bring more creativity and intuition back into my process.

This theme of making technology more accessible and human-centric was beautifully exemplified in the **"Unplugged AI" workshop**. We used board games to simulate concepts like supervised and reinforcement learning—an interesting approach that demonstrates how to make complex AI principles tangible and engaging for everyone, regardless of their technical background.

> The power to teach AI in this way is profound. It served as a perfect reminder that the most impactful technology is that which we can understand, touch, and play with.

And as the culmination of this shared learning, I'm leaving with something equally precious: a treasure trove of book recommendations and resources from this incredible community. Thank you all!




## Mindset Shifts

As the event progressed, I found myself reflecting on the subtle but powerful mindset shifts that had taken root.

One session, for instance, led me to critically rethink how we use technology and social media. It pushed me to ask a fundamental question:

> Am I using Instagram, or is Instagram using me?

This isn't about dismissing technology, but about engaging with it intentionally. We discussed how while low-quality content may not cause cognitive deterioration, it does have costs in our time, creativity and attention. This is a reminder to periodically pause and ask: **Are we using these tools the way *we* want to, or are we simply being led by them?**

This introspection seamlessly connects to the event's greatest gift: a realignment of my relationship with technology itself and a **reconnection with my "why"**.

> I remembered why I'm here—beyond the corporations and the daily tasks: because I'm genuinely passionate. Reconnecting with that core motivation was as a much-needed reset.

**This sentiment was echoed in a wonderful conversation with a fellow attendee.** We found ourselves asking: *Why are we like this?* Why do we, and so many in our community, carry our work as a core part of our identity, deeply intertwined with our personal values and ethics? It's more than just a job to disconnect from at 5 PM. For us, the "how" and "why" we build things is a reflection of who we are.

These two days truly recharged my batteries, refilling my energy and passion to keep moving forward. I left feeling not just informed, but transformed. I can't wait to see you all again at the next Bilbostack! ❤️
