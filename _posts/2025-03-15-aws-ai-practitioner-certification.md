Although Iâ€™ve spent over two years working on AI and machine learning projects in AWS and GCP, including clustering, prediction, NLP with BERT classifiers, and semantic data modeling, I felt that earning a formal certification would be a great way to structure and validate my knowledge. I wanted to dive deeper into the specific AI/ML services that AWS offers, which is the focus of this certification, and this is why I decided to go for it!

Want to know how I prepared for the exam? Let me share the details in this post!


## ðŸ¤“ My Preparation Process

To prepare, I followed [Stephane Maarek's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-ai-practitioner-certified/?srsltid=AfmBOopWmgrCGQgHeJlNOfqmnrPyesaL4FE55MArJ_dvdDV_u2CGmFQZ&couponCode=25BBPMXFREETRMT), which I really recommend. Stephane is an excellent instructor â€” he explains concepts clearly, ties them to practical examples, and makes the learning experience enjoyable.

I also practiced with his [set of mock exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-ai-practitioner/?srsltid=AfmBOoqZd3qvncvzIiGPqfvqIQ_pCtBmcmT_71VPbDpjesS22JCSBAN6&couponCode=25BBPMXFREETRMT), which helped me get used to the format and types of questions I would face in the real exam.

In total, I spent around **a month** preparing, combining short daily sessions with deeper weekend study blocks.



## ðŸ“‹ Exam Experience

The exam was taken **online** via [Pearson VUE](https://home.pearsonvue.com/) â€” the experience was smooth, and there were no issues or incidents during the exam process. I was able to take the exam from the comfort of my home, and it was well-structured and well-managed throughout. Given my prior experience in both cloud and AI/ML, most questions felt approachable â€” but I believe the real key was understanding **how AWS positions and integrates its AI/ML services**, like SageMaker, Rekognition, Translate, Comprehend, and Lex.

Passing on the first attempt was very satisfying, and the certification helped me solidify concepts.

I'm proud to share that I have officially earned the **AWS Certified AI Practitioner** certification! You can view my certificate [here](https://cp.certmetrics.com/amazon/en/public/verify/credential) by entering the validation number `b71c1aeb29e342f4ae8b098874b581da`.


## âœ… Final Thoughts

If youâ€™re already working in machine learning and want to strengthen your understanding of AWS services â€” or if youâ€™re aiming to bridge the gap between AI/ML and cloud â€” this certification is a great step.

Itâ€™s beginner-friendly for those newer to the field, but it also offers value to experienced professionals by helping structure and formalize knowledge.
