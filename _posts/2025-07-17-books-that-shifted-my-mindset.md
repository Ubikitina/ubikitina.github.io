I‚Äôve always believed that great leadership starts from within. The more we understand ourselves, others, and the systems we operate in, the better we can show up ‚Äî for our teams, our communities, and our own growth.

Throughout the years, I‚Äôve learned a lot from mentors, teammates ‚Äî and also from books. Some of them have challenged me, shaped my mindset, and helped me grow both personally and professionally.

Here are a few books that truly shifted my mindset ‚Äî and might shift yours too. I‚Äôve grouped them by the kind of skill they helped me develop, from communicating with clarity to thinking strategically. Whether you're leading a team or just leading your own life, I hope you find something here that speaks to you.

## **1. Psychology for Everyday Life**

        ### **"Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most" by Sheila Heen, Douglas Stone and Bruce Patton**  
        This book reinforced the **importance of communication**, especially when things get uncomfortable. It gave me practical, compassionate tools to navigate tough moments with honesty and empathy. It's incredibly well-written and highly practical.

        > **How it helped me:** I started applying some of its tools during one-on-ones and feedback sessions ‚Äî it‚Äôs made those conversations more human, and more productive.

        **Who it‚Äôs for:** Ideal for anyone looking to improve how they communicate in work, relationships, or leadership.

    <div>
        ### **"C√≥mo mandar a la mierda de forma educada" by Alba Cardalda**  
        This book was a game-changer for understanding and applying the importance of **setting healthy boundaries**. Alba Cardalda's approach is insightful and research-based ‚Äî something I really appreciate. I even attended the book launch in Barcelona, which made the experience even more personal.

        > **How it helped me:** It gave me language and confidence to set clearer limits.

        **Who it‚Äôs for:** Anyone who struggles with saying ‚Äúno‚Äù or needs tools to manage their relationships more assertively.

    <div>
        ### **"Belonging: The Science of Creating Connection and Bridging Divides" by Geoffrey Cohen**  
        The **concept of belonging** is something I deeply care about ‚Äî both in teams and society. This book emphasizes how vital connection is, even across big divides.

        > **Honest take:** While the message resonated, I found the book a bit long and somewhat repetitive. Still, its core ideas are powerful.

        **Who it‚Äôs for:** Anyone curious about social psychology and the dynamics of inclusion and connection.

## **2. Strategic Thinking & Complex Problem Solving**

Books that helped me develop a sharper, more analytical lens for understanding systems, patterns, and decision-making.

    <img src="[/assets/images/thinking-in-systems.jpg]" alt="Book Cover: Thinking in Systems" style="width: 150px; margin-right: 20px; float: left;">
    <div>
        ### **"Thinking in Systems: A Primer" by Donella H. Meadows**  
        **I absolutely loved this book. Highly recommend it.** It completely opened my eyes to how **systems thinking** can be applied to everything: team dynamics, product design, social issues, even personal habits. I initially approached this after studying systems biology, but this book made me realize how broadly applicable the concept of systems is.

        > **How it helped me:** It changed how I diagnose problems ‚Äî I now look at the structures and patterns beneath the surface, not just the symptoms. It also helped me understand the **inherent resistance of systems in equilibrium** ‚Äî and why change is often harder than it looks. The book offers thoughtful strategies to navigate and influence these systems more effectively.

        **Who it‚Äôs for:** A must-read for analytical minds, problem-solvers, and anyone who wants to understand the root causes of complex problems ‚Äî and how to transform them.

    <div>
        ### **"Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman**  
        This book dives into the **two systems our brain uses to make decisions** ‚Äî and the biases that come with each. It‚Äôs a deep, fascinating read on how we think.

        > **How it helped me:** It made me more aware of the shortcuts and mental traps I (and others) fall into, especially under pressure.

        **Who it‚Äôs for:** Anyone interested in behavioral psychology, decision-making, and improving critical thinking.

    <div>
        ### **"The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb**  
        The central idea ‚Äî that rare, unpredictable events shape history more than we think ‚Äî is fascinating.

        > **Honest take:** It‚Äôs a bit dense, and I personally wished for more scientific grounding. But it made me think differently about uncertainty and planning.

        **Who it‚Äôs for:** For those curious about risk, unpredictability, and the limits of forecasting.

        ### **"The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You" by Julie Zhuo**  
        I read this book to better understand the challenges and responsibilities of management. It gave me a clearer view of what effective leadership looks like ‚Äî not just in theory, but in the day-to-day reality of working with others and supporting their growth.

        > **How it helped me:** It helped me reflect on the kind of leader I want to be ‚Äî and what it really takes to help others grow. I‚Äôve already found some of its lessons useful in team dynamics and collaborative projects.

        **Who it‚Äôs for:** Managers, team leaders, collaborators, or anyone curious about what real-world leadership entails.
