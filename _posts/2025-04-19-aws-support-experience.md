A few weeks ago, I was working on a pretty intense project that relies heavily on **AWS Glue** as part of our data pipeline. I work at a company where we use **AWS for both development and production**, and luckily, we have an active **AWS Support plan**. Although it‚Äôs been available to us all this time, I had never used it... until now. And I have to say ‚Äî it was a really positive surprise. üòå


## AWS Support Plans ‚Äì A Quick Overview

Before diving into my personal experience, it‚Äôs worth mentioning that AWS offers several [support plans](https://aws.amazon.com/es/premiumsupport/plans/) tailored to different organizational needs:

- **Basic**: Free, includes access to documentation, forums, and limited AWS Trusted Advisor.
- **Developer**: Ideal for development environments, provides business hours email support from AWS engineers.
- **Business**: Commonly used in production environments. Includes 24/7 access to engineers, live chat, and phone support with fast response times (under 1 hour for critical issues).
- **Enterprise / Enterprise On-Ramp**: Offers personalized support with a Technical Account Manager (TAM), proactive planning, architectural reviews, and even more aggressive SLAs.

In our case, we use the **Enterprise plan**, which gives us access to dedicated technical resources, proactive guidance, and the ability to escalate issues when needed. üöÄ


## My Experience: Trouble with AWS Glue

I was running a **Glue Job** that seemed to be working‚Ä¶ until it didn‚Äôt. When inspecting the output, I realized that **some columns were simply missing** from the loaded data. These columns were present in the source Parquet files, but had very few values.

Glue was completely ignoring them ‚Äî they were either showing up as `null` or not appearing at all unless I manually defined them in the schema. ü§Ø

The only workaround I kept seeing was to **explicitly include the missing column names in the schema**. But when I tried that, Glue did read the columns ‚Äî yet **all the values were `null`**, even though I knew some records (just a few) had actual data in them. That wasn't good enough ‚Äî I needed those **sparse but important values**.

I discussed the issue with my team, but **no one had a definitive answer** either ‚Äî it was a head-scratcher for all of us. I searched on StackOverflow, forums, AWS docs, and various troubleshooting blogs. Nothing. I found other users reporting the same issue, but **no concrete solution**. After spending way too much time on this, I remembered‚Ä¶ we have **AWS Support**!


## How the Process Went

I went to the AWS Support Center and opened a **support case**. I was offered two options:

- **Chat**, with a guaranteed response within 24 hours  
- **Live call** with technical agents

Since my project was time-sensitive, I chose the second option. Within 15 minutes, I was connected with **two support engineers** ‚Äî both incredibly friendly, professional, and clearly very knowledgeable.

I explained the issue, they asked a few clarifying questions, and quickly consulted their **internal knowledge base**.

And yes ‚Äî they had the solution. üòç


### The Solution: Why Are My Columns Missing?

The issue was related to how Spark (and by extension AWS Glue) handles schemas when reading Parquet files with sparse columns ‚Äî columns that don‚Äôt appear in every file.

The fix was to enable **schema merging** using this configuration:

```
glueContext.sql("set spark.sql.parquet.mergeSchema=true")
````

You can check out my full answer (which helped others too!) here on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76118661/missing-columns-in-aws-glue/79516883#79516883).



## Final Thoughts ‚Äì Use AWS Support!

If your company has access to **AWS Support**, **don‚Äôt hesitate to use it**. Sometimes we feel like we have to figure everything out on our own, but having access to experienced professionals with internal documentation can make all the difference.

The support I received was **fast, friendly, and highly effective**. I‚Äôm genuinely impressed. Having access to this level of support during a critical moment made a real impact on my project.
