As 2025 comes to a close, I find myself sitting down to reflect on what has been, without a doubt, one of the most transformative years of my professional journey. It’s been a year of building, learning, and most importantly, reconnecting with the reasons why I love this field.

Looking back, 2025 wasn't just about closing tickets or shipping code; it was about evolving as a professional and as a member of this incredible tech community.

## Milestones

This year was significant for "sharpening the saw". I set out to validate my experience and push my boundaries, resulting in three key certifications that represent different facets of my work:

* **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03):** A journey that began at the AWS Summit Madrid and served as a deep dive into the "AWS way of thinking".
* **AWS Certified AI Practitioner:** A natural step as AI moved from the periphery to the center of our daily workflows.
* **Neo4j Certified Professional:** Expanding my graph database expertise to tackle complex data relationships more effectively.

Beyond the badges, these certifications were about consolidation, moving from "knowing how to use a tool" to "understanding the architecture and the WHY behind the solution".

## Community

If there is one thing 2025 reinforced, it's that **software is built by people, for people**. Participating in conferences wasn't just about the talks, but about the energy of the community:

* **BilboStack & AWS Summit Madrid:** These events provided the strategic context and the "real tech vibes" needed to stay inspired.
* **TheAntiEvent:** My first Open Space experience, which reminded me that our work is a reflection of our values and ethics. It was a safe space to share the "how" and "why" behind what we build.

I’ve met so many passionate people this year. People who, like me, see this field as a core part of who they are. Thank you all!

## The Shift

Perhaps the most profound change this year has been in *how* I work. Following the reflections sparked at TheAntiEvent, I’ve moved toward a more hands-on, creative process.

I’ve embraced **"vibe coding"** using AI assistants not just for speed, but as partners in creativity (and *in crime* 🤜🤛). However, I’ve done so with a **critical eye**. I’ve learned to ask myself: *Are we using these tools the way we want, or are they leading us?*. This balance of intuition and technical rigor has made me more efficient and, frankly, happier in my daily tasks.

## Looking Ahead

The horizon of 2026 looks both challenging and thrilling. We are witnessing a total transformation in our sector driven by AI. I’m eager to see how these tools continue to evolve and how they will further reshape our roles. 

My goal for the coming year is to stay at the forefront of this evolution, advancing with the sector while maintaining that human-centric focus that makes technology truly impactful.

## Gratitude

Finally, I want to say **thank you**. ❤️‍🩹

To the colleagues who challenged me, the community members who shared their knowledge, and everyone who has joined me on this path: thank you for being by my side. This year’s success is shared with all of you.

**Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!** May your 2026 be full of exciting challenges, clean code, and meaningful connections.
