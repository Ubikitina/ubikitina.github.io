    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Maialen</strong>. I am a <strong>Data Architect & Engineer</strong> with a dual background in Computer Engineering and Biochemistry. This combination allows me to approach data challenges with both technical precision and scientific rigor. I specialize in building scalable data ecosystems, focusing on transforming complex datasets into actionable business value. I’m driven by a natural interest in how systems work, whether digital or biological, and how data can bridge the gap between them.</p>
